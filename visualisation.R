# First, set the correct Working Directory. (write your code in the line below)

setwd()

# Next, we are creating a new vector
data <- c("Below Average", "Average", "Above Average", "Excellent", "Above Average", "Above Average", "Above Average", "Below Average", "Average", "Poor", "Below Average","Average","Poor", "Above Average", "Average","Above Average","Average", "Below Average","Above Average", "Above Average")

# For the following tasks please always write the code below the comment with the instructions, example:
#
# Print out the data vector
data

# Now it's your turn:
#
# Produce a frequency distribution table for the data vector and print out this table


# Plot a bar chart. Make it more presentable by labelling it properly. The bars should be ordered from Poor to Excellent.


# Plot a 3D pie chart. Make it more presentable by labelling it properly. The slices should be ordered from Poor to Excellent.


# That's all. Don't forget to push your commit.
# Just a reminder that you have to work on this task by yourself. If students submit a similar solution it will be easy to find out in GitHub which student pushed their commit first.
